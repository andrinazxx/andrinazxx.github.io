									<h3>I am on my way to become a better</h3>
									<h2>AI/Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
									<p> I have meticulously curated a captivating showcase that unveils the scope of 
										my machine learning and data science projects. 
										As an aspiring junior machine learning engineer, 
										I reveled in the spirit of collaboration in my early days as a team contributor.
										Over time, my passion for team dynamics and the art of leadership blossomed, 
										propelling me to guide and inspire groups towards remarkable achievements.
										Beyond the technical facets, my insatiable curiosity has also 
										led me to explore an array of captivating subjects. <br/>
										Please join me on this voyage.</p>

											Music Transcription algorithm using kNN, SVM, CNN and RNN</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ml1-musTrans.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> As a double major student in music technology, I proposed the topic and led a group of 5 to work on this project. 
										Our study aims to develop an <strong>advanced music genre classification system</strong> with the objective of 
										enhancing personalized recommendation mechanisms and user experience. 
										By employing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
										and Neural Networks (CNN, RNN), the comprehensive classification model is capable of 
										accommodating a wide spectrum of music genres. The dataset comprises audio recordings of 
										songs, evaluated through an array of attributes such as spectral information, 
										rhythmic patterns, along with multiple other extracted features in CSV files. 
										The efficacy of our proposed music genre classification system is gauged through numerous evaluation metrics, 
										enabling the selection of the most efficient model and optimizing models' classification 
										performance and their capability to accurately predict music genres. By demonstrating high accuracy and 
										robustness, our tool exhibits its effectiveness and dependability and promising 
										improvements in music recommendation systems.</p>

											Seismology and Markov Chain Monte Carlo in MATLAB</a></h2>

									<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" async></script>
									<p> In this project, I aimed to fit the <strong>seismology</strong> related data into a <strong>MCMC</strong> model, by using 
										three parameters from the dataset - SeismoEx.mat. The three variables I used to construct the model are: x (location), s (standard deviation, a vector full of
										ones) and y (the velocity data). I used the function inside SeisModel.m which implements the following model:
										$$m(v, D, x_0) = \frac{v}{\pi}arctan\left(\frac{x - x_0}{D}\right)$$ <br />
										The project was designed as individual work. 
										During the first half of the project, I solved the problem set by myself in MATLAB 
										and later gathered together with my group to give out a 30 minutes presentation and Q&A session to the entire class collaboratively.

											Neural Networks and SVR implementation for Earthquake prediction</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ml3-earthqk.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Everything happening with nature has tremendous impacts on human beings. Earthquakes and natural disasters may take away countless people's lives. 
										After moving to San Diego, I noticed more Earthquake notifications came to me, comparing to when I was in Shanghai. 
										I'm interested in geology since I was little, so I proposed this topic to my group. <br/>
										I led a group of 4 to work on the research question: 
										Can we accurately predict the magnitude and depth of an earthquake happening, 
										given the time and location (latitude and longitude) it will occur?
										We are able to find a dataset that contains the Data, Time, Latitude, Longitude, Magnitude, Depth, 
										and Region of the earthquake, the core components made us possible to work on the earthquake prediction model.

											Data Analysis on possible relationship between outage duration time in the U.S. and potential factors</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ml4-outage.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In the United States, power outages are always an interesting topic to research. 
										California, a big state which has more serious power issues than all other states. 
										There are many factors responsible for putting almost a million Americans into darkness: 
										environmental impact, climate change and population growth. 2020 as a special year, faces the worst power outage. 
										There are a variety of reasons that power outages happen. Thus, we raised our research question: 
										What is the most common reason that causes those major power outage in the continential U.S? 
										In addition, is there a relationship between the last time of outage with the electricity consumption and 
										number of consumer served in that state (and would that be specifically related to a certain category, 
										like residential, commercial, or industrial)? Is the land composition (percent of land and water) also a potential factor?</p>
